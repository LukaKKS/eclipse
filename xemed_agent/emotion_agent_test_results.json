Mom states the baby is usually healthy but has \"not been eating well lately.\" Doesn't own a thermometer, but knows the baby is \"hot\" and gave acetaminophen two hours prior to arrival. The baby is wrapped in a blanket, eyes open, appears listless, skin hot and moist, sunken fontanel. Respirations are regular and not labored.",

      "reasoning": "The primary emotion of fear is evident due to the concern for the baby's health, especially with symptoms like fever and listlessness. Sadness is present as the mother reflects on her baby's unusual health state, indicated by the phrase 'not been eating well lately.' Anxiety is subtly felt, likely stemming from uncertainty about the baby's condition and the lack of a thermometer. Guilt may be masked, as the mother might feel responsible for not monitoring the baby's health adequately. The overall emotional risk score is high due to the combination of fear, sadness, and anxiety, which could escalate if the baby's condition worsens.",

Sadness is also present, as the situation reflects a tragic context involving a young individual with a history of suicidality. Despair is subtly indicated by the circumstances, suggesting a deep sense of hopelessness. The masked emotion of hopelessness is inferred from the lack of any positive outlook or mention of support. The overall risk score is high due to the combination of these intense emotions and the potential for escalation in such a critical situation.",
